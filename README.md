# COMPLEX-AMPLITUDES-FOR-QUANTUM-COMPUTING-
Core Concept
The task is to create a quantum state from given complex numbers (amplitudes) that define the probabilities and phases of different quantum configurations.

What is a Quantum State?
For 2 qubits: |ψ⟩ = a0|00⟩ + a1|01⟩ + a2|10⟩ + a3|11⟩

Each amplitude (a0, a1, a2, a3) is a complex number

|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩ represent the four possible states of two qubits

Key Requirement: Normalization
The sum of probabilities must equal 1: |a0|² + |a1|² + |a2|² + |a3|² = 1

If inputs don't satisfy this, we scale them to make it true

This ensures valid quantum mechanics where probabilities sum to 100%

What the Code Does
Takes 4 complex numbers as input

Checks if they're normalized (probabilities sum to 1)

If not, scales them to make probabilities sum to 1

Returns the properly normalized state vector

Why This Matters
Foundation for quantum computing - all quantum algorithms start with state preparation

Ensures physical validity - quantum states must obey probability rules

Basic building block for more complex quantum operations

Extension to 3 Qubits
Same concept but with 8 amplitudes instead of 4

Represents states like |000⟩, |001⟩, |010⟩, ..., |111⟩
